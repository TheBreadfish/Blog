# Graduation
#### 2024-06-14

On Wenesday (2024-06-14), I graduated Middle School. I'm not sure how I feel about this tbh, I mean the summer just snuck up on me so fast, what am I supposed to do now?

*Well, what is this you're reading?*

A blog, that's right. So I've decicided to make a blog, maybe one day I'll be able to host this on a website and all that fun jazz. -Speaking of that, what would I use to host this website? Anyways, now I have a whole summer to do what ever I want! I think I might, *if I put in the effort*, have a functioning blog and website up some day. 

But, to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even do that, I have other things to do, and also the [CubeKrowd](https://www.cubekrowd.net) server needs me. *(It doesn't actually need me, but I love the server and all the wonderful people on there <3).* This summer, I think I may have the time to become builder on CK, and I think I have a pretty good chance, considering that a while ago that the entire build team disapeared due to "do real life stuff", and that Hydrintegral and TALLPUP were asking me once that if I considered joining the Build Team.


Anyways, I hope that this summer will be amazing and will be a productive one, especially because next year I'll be going into highschool, and that's where you have to start to think about college. D:>
