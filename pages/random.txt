# Random Thoughts
Below will be a collection of my random thoughts, in no particular order. I often text these thoughts to myself, and sometimes I'll put them on this website or as my discord status.

* So if interrobangs are ⁉️ (or !?), and according to discord, that the ‼️ (or !!) is called "bangbang", does that mean that a hyopthetical emoji called interrointerro (probally would look like ❓❓) exists? 
* I also hate it when people use tables to create calendars, and then have inconsistent spacing for the times, like its supposed to be usefull as a calendar, but instead you make the lunch the largest thing on the table, while its only **ONE hour** long, while the actual classes are a **THIRD of the size** of the lunch visually, but **1.5 HOURS** long!!! That doesn't line up!
* I hate those bike "lanes" that gve you 6-4 inches to ride in- like really? come on
* Speed limits are made to reflect how people are *expected* to drive on a road, not what is *actually* safe or acceptable
* It is suprisingly easy to make somthing misleading but still true
* Tacocopter was FAKE?!!!!

* A place with only roundabouts and no stop signs or traffic lights would be so satisfying- you wouldn't have to stop at all to get around!
